//There are infinite truthy values in JS so let us focus on what all falsy values are there in JS

//These are the following falsy values in JS they are -

`0` - returns false when checked through Boolean(0) {fot both 0 and - 0 }
`NaN` - a Not an Number returns false
`''` - an empty string also returns false
    `undefined` - returns false
    `null` - also returns false
